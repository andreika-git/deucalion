+ find a way to connect OSC_OUT of STM to OSC_IN of Kinetis
+ which one is better for Kinetis - K-line or CAN? = LIN/K-line, and very optional CAN
+ should all inputs have pull-up resistors?
+ find backup battery solition
+ reserve a pin-header footprint for a small LIN-bus breakout board over the IC
- where is Tx/Rx for CAN and LIN modules?
- we need a PPTC on V12
- OUT_EXT1/2
- we need separate SPI_CS pins for TLE6240 & TLE-modules
- make sure that all digital inputs in STM32 and Kinetis use different interrupt channels?
  * what about Matt's idea of using the compare inputs for less jitter?
- do we need pull-ups for outputs?
	= only for OUT_TACH & OUT_FUEL?
- we need a diode for CE output too?
- put a spare 3.3v regulator footprint on board (in case the STM32-mini's reg is cr@p)
- place pads on all important traces (kinetis-stm, first of all)
  - put pads for debug-SWD for Kinetis
- find 2x10+2x18 HIGH female pin-headers (8.5mm height, 2.54mm pitch) at digikey/mouser to fit into the L-shaped connector of the STM32-mini board
- Kinetis: "For ADC signals adjacent to VDD/VSS or the XTAL pins some degradation in the ADC performance may be observed."
- make sure we don't phantom-power Kinetis via STM32-USB (especially RESET_b pin!)
	* use pull-up resistor from RESET_b to V5 (10k) and filter capacitor (100n)
	* use open-drain output of STM32 to control it
	* use series resistor in-between (1k)
- make sure we use bootloader-compatible USART for K-line in STM32-mini
- put silkscreen hint to solder the DC-DC module correctly, it's important!
- add SMT pads to inductor TH-footprint (make double footprint)
- add one more LED
- add jumper-resistors to ignition switch gates
- check paste masks for large pads/polys
- pcb logo :)
