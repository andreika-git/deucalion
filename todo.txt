+ find a way to connect OSC_OUT of STM to OSC_IN of Kinetis
+ which one is better for Kinetis - K-line or CAN? = LIN/K-line, and very optional CAN
- should all inputs have pull-up resistors?
- put a spare 3.3v regulator footprint on board (in case the STM32-mini's reg is cr@p)
- find backup battery solition and add the footprint
- place pads on all important traces (kinetis-stm, first of all)
- find 2x10+2x18 HIGH female pin-headers (8.5mm height, 2.54mm pitch) at digikey/mouser to fit into the L-shaped connector of the STM32-mini board
- reserve a pin-header footprint for a small LIN-bus breakout board over the IC
- Kinetis: "For ADC signals adjacent to VDD/VSS or the XTAL pins some degradation in the ADC performance may be observed."
- make sure we don't phantom-power Kinetis via STM32-USB (especially RESET_b pin!)
	* use pull-up resistor from RESET_b to V5 (10k) and filter capacitor (100n)
	* use open-drain output of STM32 to control it
	* use series resistor in-between (1k)
