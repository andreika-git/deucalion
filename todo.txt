+ find a way to connect OSC_OUT of STM to OSC_IN of Kinetis
+ which one is better for Kinetis - K-line or CAN? = LIN/K-line, and very optional CAN
- find backup battery solition and add the footprint
- place pads on all important traces (kinetis-stm, first of all)
- reserve a pin-header footprint for a small LIN-bus breakout board over the IC
- Kinetis: "For ADC signals adjacent to VDD/VSS or the XTAL pins some degradation in the ADC performance may be observed."
