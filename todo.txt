+ find a way to connect OSC_OUT of STM to OSC_IN of Kinetis
+ which one is better for Kinetis - K-line or CAN? = LIN/K-line, and very optional CAN
+ should all inputs have pull-up resistors?
+ find backup battery solition
+ reserve a pin-header footprint for a small LIN-bus breakout board over the IC
+ make sure that all digital inputs in STM32 and Kinetis use different interrupt channels?
+ do we need pull-ups for outputs? = only for OUT_TACH & OUT_FUEL?
+ we need a PPTC on V12
+ OUT_EXT1/2
+ we need a diode for CE output too?
+ we need MOD_SPI! (for TLE-modules: 4 pins for SPI + 2 direct pins?)
+ add one more LED
+ add jumper-resistors to ignition switch gates
+ we don't put a spare 3.3v regulator footprint on board (in case the STM32-mini's reg is cr@p), it can be soldered directly on STM32-mini!
+ put quartz footprint for Kinetis
+ make sure we don't phantom-power Kinetis via STM32-USB (especially RESET_b pin!)
+ add pcb-jumpers to connect USART and CAN of Kinetis to LIN/CAN modules instead on STM32
+ make sure we use bootloader-compatible Rx/Tx for K-line/CAN in Kinetis
+ check Tx/Rx for CAN and LIN modules
+ 0.35mm vias? or 0.5mm vias?
+ J15/J17 problem
+ test the connector footprint once more
+ add BTS3410G
- add two pcb jumpers for Mikas 10.3 compatibility (49-50 and 56-38 connector pins)
- add SMT pads to inductor & electrolytic capacitors TH-footprint (make double footprint)
- add keys for quad-diodes
- add thermal vias to TLE
- check creepage dist for ignition (incl. pours)
	* try 2.0 mm creepage & 1.0 mm traces
- place pads on all important traces (kinetis-stm, first of all)
  - put pads for debug-SWD for Kinetis
- find 2x10+2x18 HIGH female pin-headers (8.5mm height, 2.54mm pitch) at digikey/mouser to fit into the L-shaped connector of the STM32-mini board
- Kinetis: "For ADC signals adjacent to VDD/VSS or the XTAL pins some degradation in the ADC performance may be observed."
- check if all 3 CAN boards fit
- put silkscreen hint to solder the DC-DC module correctly, it's important!
- add slots between ignition switches and STM32 connector
	* pcbway: "No extra charge need for slots (smaller than 10 pcs on one board)"
	* "Pls kindly add these slots in GKO or GM1 layers, or separated slot layer"
- check paste masks for large pads/polys
- check BOM & part numbers
- check TH drill sizes
- define pcb outline and cut-outs
- mounting holes?
- pcb logo :)
