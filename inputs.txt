*** Inputs on other ECUs ***

* We have 20 (!) inputs
* RC-filter: "Each ADC input must have an RC filter as shown in the following figure. The maximum value of R must be RAS max if fast sampling and high resolution are
  	required. The value of C must be chosen to ensure that the RC time constant is very small compared to the sample period."
  - series resistor (8-channel arrays: CAY16-102J8LF)
    * it seems that MKE1xF already has some input series resistance of 2-5kOm on all ADC pins, but we still need ours
    * MKE1xF has diode clamp protection of 3mA source/sink on all input pins (Iicio - DC injection current rating, table #27 datasheet)
    * 1k+1nF gives 160kHz bandwidth
  - TVS-diodes array
  	4-channel: 
  		DT1042-04SO-7, DF5A6.8LJELM, Wurth 82402304
  		SOT236-T05~T24C Series (Bourns)
  		NUP4201
  	8-channel arrays: SP8008-08UTG, ESD7016MUTAG
  - or EMI-filters with ESD-protection? (6-channel NUF6400MN etc.)
  - small filtering caps (4-channel arrays: CA064X103K1RACAUTO)
    * "Place input filter capacitors as close to the MCU as possible."
  - optional pullups/pulldowns (needed for some sensors)
- voltage reference outputs for sensors
  - we need 2-3 configurable resistive voltage dividers (2.5v by default) with filter caps
  - used by VR and knock sensors in 'fake' bipolar mode (sensor "zero" is aligned with 2.5v reference voltage, and we get 0..5v swing for ADC input)
- battery voltage divider & TVS-protecion (RBO40-40G?)
- misc. passive circuity
  - 4 passive caps for Kinetis

--------------------
We group all inputs by 4.
1) Crank,Knock,Cam,VSS
	* we put more strong overcurrent protection (because of VR crank sensor or unpredictable Knock sensor)
	* and Cam/VSS sensors are digital anyway, so it doesn't matter for them
	* also we separate them from more 'delicate' analog signals because of interference
	* We need a combination of clamp diodes + TVS here: clamp diodes give low capacitance, and TVS gives a stronger surge protection
	* Series resistor = 4.7k
2) "Magnificent four": TPS, CLT, IAT, O2S
	* CLT, IAT require strong pull-ups (2.7k)
	* all 4 require strong LP-filtering
	* Series resistor = 3.3k
3) Group3: MAP1, MAP2, MAP3, MAP4 (...or could be MAP + 3 more sensors!)
	* Series resistor = 3.3k
4) Group4: O2S_2, Res_1, Res_2, x (...could be PPS or EGT sensor; only 3 used)
	* Series resistor = 3.3k
5) Group5: Aux_Triggers 1,2,3,4 (... or Inertia,AC,Steering,Clutch switches)
	* we also put more strong overcurrent protection on these inputs (for ion sensing)
	* and separate these signals
	* requires pull-ups (10k?)
	* We need a combination of clamp diodes + TVS here: clamp diodes give low capacitance, and TVS gives a stronger surge protection
	* Series resistor = 4.7k

Pull-up/down groups:
1) Crank (#15), Knock (#19), TPS (#16) and O2S (#18) = 1MOhm resistor (weak pull)
2) Cam (#79), VSS (#59), CLT (#39) and IAT (#40) = 3.3kOhm resistor (strong pull, default: all pullups to +5V)
3) MAP1 (#37), MAP2 (#38), MAP3 (#41), MAP4 (#42) = 10 kOhm (default: pulldowns to GND)
4) O2S_2 (#55), Reserved_1 (#58), Reserved_2 (#78), x = 1MOhm (weak pull), only 3 used
5) Trig3 (#74), Trig4 (#75), Trig5 (#76), Trig6 (#77) = 10 kOhm (default: all pullups to +5V)

Notes:
* MAP MPX4250AP has only 0.1mA output current capability, so 10k pulldown is close to a lower threshold?
