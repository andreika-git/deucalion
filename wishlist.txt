- add 1206 optional jumpers to connect 25+26 pins of the ECU connector to 8+68 pins. 
  This will allow to use the ECU without TLE7* chip at all (to some extent)!
  The following pins/functions will be disabled:
  - #10 fuel consumption output
  - #25-26 injector 5+6 outputs
  - #28 lambda2 heating output
  - #29 ECF2 output
  - #31 CheckEngine lamp output
  - #46 canister purge valve output
  - #69 ac relay output
  * maybe provide something for CE lamp as well?
- add high-side output configuration jumpers for some TLE7* outputs
- add a jumper for +5V power source from USB? It allows to use the board in 'usb-workbench' mode without 12V supply
- route two 5V FXIO outputs both to ECU connector and pcb-module extension header
- make a couple of adapter connector boards for:
  - Janvar-5.1
  - MS for 35pin amp seal connectors
- make a couple of adapter brain boards for:
  - STM32F4-Discovery
  - Core407v (Black)
  - ...?
