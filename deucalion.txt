- Deucalion board (c) andreika:
  - main concepts:
    1) Only bare essentials on-board with as few components as possible
    2) Minimum ("paranoic") soldering should be used in assembly
  - current config draft:
    - 2 layer board less than 100x100 mm
    - STM32F board as a main cpu
      * currently its Core407V-mini ("VCC-GND") board
    - Kinetis KE14F on-board - used as an ADC & trigger software controller
      * current choice: MKE16F512VLH16
      	841-MKE16F512VLH16 @ www.mouser.com
      	= $7.05
        * KE1xF series
        * "512" means 512kb Flash, "V" - temperature range
        * "LH" means LQFP-64 (64 pins)
        * "16" means 168 MHz (potentially up to 180MHz)
        * 64kb RAM (or 32kb for 256kb Flash version)
        * $6 (digikey/mouser/farnell availability)
      - alternatives:
      	* https://www.digikey.com/catalog/en/partgroup/kinetis-ke1xf512/63778
      	  MKE14*, MKE16*, MKE18* - just different FlexCAN periferals (14="No FlexCAN", 16="1 FlexCAN", 18="2 FlexCAN")
    	* or cheaper *F256VLH16, 256kb versions (pin-compatible?)
    	* cypress:
			MB9BF164LPMC-G-JNE2 (LQFP-64 $6, 160 MHz, Flash 256 kB, RAM 32 kB, but only 2 ADCs, no CMPs?)
    		S6E2CCAH0AGV20000 (LQFP-144 200 MHz, Flash 2MB, RAM 256 kB, 3 ADCs)
    	* teensy 3.x (here just for firmware reference):
    		MK20DX256VLH7 (3.3V :((( 72 MHz :( 2 ADCs :( $20 for the board)
    - TLE6240GP for injector and low-side outputs (up to 16 total)
    	* Current status is "not for new design", but still widely used and available
    	726-TLE6240GP @ www.mouser.com
    	= $8.68
    	ebay/aliexpress
    	= $1-3
    - (optional) BTS3410G for two more injector outputs
    - use an external DC-DC board (fixed 12->5V on LM2596, see below), and additional inductor filter
    - and additional +3.3V fixed regulator
    - multiple connectors for module pcb extensions
    - That's it!
  - no external ADC, MAX9926, add data will be sent to the main CPU via SPI+GPIO, like imitating an external ADC
  - all inputs (analog, digital) are directed into kinetis
  - and +5V outputs too! it has 8 special "high drive" pins (5V 18mA source/sink), enough for driving 'logical' COPs or external modules
  - if it's possible, we can squeeze in ion-sense detectors too!
  - output channel driver (TLE6240) are connected both to STM32 and Kinetis via SPI (4-6 gpio + 4 SPI pins)
  - estimated board cost:
    1) pcb & main components
    + $10 for 10pcs pcb manufacture in China
    + $10 for STM32F4 board
    + $7 for 256kb Kinetis
    + $3 for TLE6240
    + $2 for DC-DC
    + $10? for other passive components
    = < $50 total
    2) Partial China assembly estimate:
      + $90 for 10 pcs?
  - wants and wishes:
    - DRV8825 module footprint on Deucalion
    - CAN/LIN transceiver
    - Kinetis firmware update via the main STM32 board
- STM32F4:
  - pinout estimates:
  	* See pin_map.xlsx
  - We'll use this solution for backup power (VBAT):
    1) Use V12_Perm (#12) as a power source for backup VBAT input of STM32 (and use a diode to also supply V12_Perm from V12 if needed)
    2) Use relatively large capacitor (100uF) to maintain the VBAT voltage for ~2 mins more after V12_Perm is disconnected
    3) Use on-board EEPROM IC of STM32-mini board to store all long-term data instead of STM32's NVRAM

  - thoughts/questions?
    - Chibios is good for Kinetis? There's a "Teensy 3" ARM-Cortex-M4 K20x (MK20DX128) port in Chibios4-Contrib
      * ~100 kb of code, should be possible to adapt for MKE14F
      * http://www.chibios.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=652
      * there's a bunch of ADC, GPIO, SPI and UART drivers for all Kinetis family?
    - openocd seems to support KE1xF.
    - gcc toolchain is good for Kinetis?
    - has some peculiar features like NVROM/"Emulated EEPROM", and special ROM for built-in bootloader!
    - are these 3 analog CMPs with _independent_ 8-bit DACs really nice for trigger processing?
    - each ADC is capable of 1.2MSPS max (10-bit mode)
    - no conflicting pins for our goals? 64-pin is enough?
    - it seems that all GPIOs have EXT_INT, and we can use it as a low-latency COPs driver!
    - how to syncronize with an external OSC from STM32?
      = "Up to 60 MHz DC external square wave input clock"
    - what's CMP-output of ADC? is it useful?
    - do we need built-in DAC?
    - no usage for UART? CAN? What's the best for CPU-CPU communication? 
    - And what about the firmware update? UART still needed?
  - "emergency mode"
    - Deucalion may be capable of minimalistic ECU operation even without the main board?!
    - Kinetis can control the outputs, and it already has all analog data
    - the only problem is less RAM and CPU resources (busy by trigger processing?)
    - but maybe it's still enough for some very simplistic emergency operation?
    - Warning! To use LIN/K-line in standalone mode, a +3.3v external regulator needs to be installed (see below)
  - SPIs can be used by built-in bootloader to update a firmware of Kinetis directly from the STM32!
  - pin-map conflicts:
    - The high-drive pins are: 2=D0 1=D1 15=D15 14=D16 19=B4 18=B5 60=E0 59=E1, configured with Portx_PCRn[DSE] 
      * "All other GPIOs are normal drive only" (Datasheet, page #48)
    - We can use only 6 hi-drive pins (to drive 6 ignition channels) because they conflict with SPI0 and SPI1 pinouts.
    - We need both SPIs, and SPI1 has the ONLY pin-mapping option in 64-in package! So we cannot use pins 1 and 2 for two more high-drive channels...
    - Besides, to free more hi-drive pins, we moved SPI0 pins to other mappings which are not supported by the internal bootloader!
    - So to use the bootloader, we have to use SPI1 to communicate with the STM32. And SPI0 is left to the TLEs.
    - The upside is that SPI1 uses high-drive pin capabilities for maximum transfer speed!..

	* The reason to use this module is poor on-board regulator:
		"The 3.3 Volt power is supplied by an RT9193 'DE=AD' voltage regulator. This regulator is underpowered to supply both the STM32 and the SD card, 
		 let alone external peripherals. If you use the SD card and require more power, you have to supply the board externally or replace the regulator."
	  RT9193 is in SOT-23-5 package, so we'd better use our external regulator board.

  - 5V:

    * Kinetis = 150mA
    * TLE6240 = 10mA
	* SD-card = 100mA
	* CAN,LIN,.. = up to 100mA

	= 1A power supply would be enough...
	  * it's 0.75W power dissipation for 85% efficiency, it's ok!
      * And thus, SO-8 package is enough for DC-DC regulator?
