- Deucalion board (c) andreika:
  - main concepts:
    1) Only bare essentials on-board with as few components as possible
    2) Minimum ("paranoic") soldering should be used in assembly
  - current config draft:
    - 2 layer board less than 100x100 mm
    - STM32F board as a main cpu
      * currently its Core407V-mini ("VCC-GND") board
    - Kinetis KE14F on-board - used as an ADC & trigger software controller
      * current choice: MKE16F512VLH16
        * KE1xF series
        * "512" means 512kb Flash, "V" - temperature range
        * "LH" means LQFP-64 (64 pins)
        * "16" means 168 MHz (potentially up to 180MHz)
        * 64kb RAM (or 32kb for 256kb Flash version)
        * $6 (digikey/mouser/farnell availability)
      - alternatives:
      	* https://www.digikey.com/catalog/en/partgroup/kinetis-ke1xf512/63778
      	  MKE14*, MKE16*, MKE18* - just different FlexCAN periferals (14="No FlexCAN", 16="1 FlexCAN", 18="2 FlexCAN")
    	* or cheaper *F256VLH16, 256kb versions (pin-compatible?)
    	* cypress:
			MB9BF164LPMC-G-JNE2 (LQFP-64 $6, 160 MHz, Flash 256 kB, RAM 32 kB, but only 2 ADCs, no CMPs?)
    		S6E2CCAH0AGV20000 (LQFP-144 200 MHz, Flash 2MB, RAM 256 kB, 3 ADCs)
    	* teensy 3.x (here just for firmware reference):
    		MK20DX256VLH7 (3.3V :((( 72 MHz :( 2 ADCs :( $20 for the board)
    - TLE8110ED for injector and low-side outputs (up to 10 total)
    - TLE75602-ESH for low-/high-side outputs (up to 8 total, configurable)
    - use an external DC-DC board (fixed 12->5V on LM2596, see below), and additional inductor filter
    - and additional +3.3V fixed regulator
    - multiple connectors for module pcb extensions
    - That's it!
  - no external ADC, MAX9926, add data will be sent to the main CPU via SPI+GPIO, like imitating an external ADC
  - all inputs (analog, digital) are directed into kinetis
  - and +5V outputs too! it has 8 special "high drive" pins (5V 18mA source/sink), enough for driving 'logical' COPs or external modules
  - if it's possible, we can squeeze in ion-sense detectors too!
  - output channel drivers (TLE8110+TLE75602) are connected both to STM32 and Kinetis via SPI (4-6 gpio + 4 SPI pins)
  - estimated board cost:
    1) pcb & main components
    + $10 for 10pcs pcb manufacture in China
    + $10 for STM32F4 board
    + $6 for 256kb Kinetis
    + $6 for TLE8110ED
    + $5 for TLE75602-ESH
    + $0.5 for DC-DC
    + $1.5 for a few passive components
    = $40 total
    2) Partial China assembly estimate:
      + $119 for 10 pcs -- 138 SMT pads just for the three chips soldering (64+37+37)
  - wants and wishes:
    - DRV8826 module footprint on Deucalion
    - CAN/LIN transciever
    - Kinetis firmware update via the main STM32 board
- STM32F4:
  - pinout estimates:
    - OSC_OUT pin
    - 6 inputs (from Kinetis)
    - 6 GPIO outputs for injectors (via TLE8110ED)
    - 6 GPIO outputs for Kinetis (COPs)
    - 12 GPIO outputs for modules (2-3 for stepper, 2-3 for ETB, 
    - 3*3 SPI pins (Kinetis, TLEs, modules)
    - 6 SPI_CS pins(?)
    - 2 CAN pins
    - 2 UART pins
    -----------
    ~50-60 pins used
  - misc:
    - external backup battery (for wider brain-board compatibility)
- KINETIS:
  - pinout estimates:
    - 16 ADC channels (split between 3 adcs?)
    - plus 3 more inputs (3 CMPs) and outputs(attenuation?), for triggers
    - 8 high-drive outputs
    - 8 inputs (to control the outputs from the main CPU)
    - SPI 4 pins (or 8 pins? see "emergency mode")
    - 4 additional outputs? (see "emergency mode")
    - watchdog/supervisor pins? (see reset_b)
    - OSC_IN 1 pin
  - thoughts/questions?
    - Chibios is good for Kinetis? There's a "Teensy 3" ARM-Cortex-M4 K20x (MK20DX128) port in Chibios4-Contrib
      * ~100 kb of code, should be possible to adapt for MKE14F
      * http://www.chibios.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=652
      * there's a bunch of ADC, GPIO, SPI and UART drivers for all Kinetis family?
    - openocd seems to support KE1xF.
    - gcc toolchain is good for Kinetis?
    - has some peculiar features like NVROM/"Emulated EEPROM", and special ROM for built-in bootloader!
    - are these 3 analog CMPs with _independent_ 8-bit DACs really nice for trigger processing?
    - each ADC is capable of 1.2MSPS max (10-bit mode)
    - no conflicting pins for our goals? 64-pin is enough?
    - it seems that all GPIOs have EXT_INT, and we can use it as a low-latency COPs driver!
    - how to syncronize with an external OSC from STM32?
      = "Up to 60 MHz DC external square wave input clock"
    - what's CMP-output of ADC? is it useful?
    - do we need built-in DAC?
    - no usage for UART? CAN? What's the best for CPU-CPU communication? 
    - And what about the firmware update? UART still needed?
  - "emergency mode"
    - Deucalion may be capable of minimalistic ECU operation even without the main board?!
    - Kinetis can control the outputs, and it already has all analog data
    - the only problem is less RAM and CPU resources (busy by trigger processing?)
    - but maybe it's still enough for some very simplistic emergency operation?
- Deucalion questions:
  - what's the difference between TLE8110ED and TLE8110EE?
    - DIFFERENT PACKAGES
    - TLE8110EE is NRND, so a "no go" :(
    - year of production (TLE8110ED=2018, TLE8110EE=2013, possible NRND?)
    - price (TLE8110ED=$9, TLE8110EE=$6)
    - if 1 TLE8110 is sufficient (and we use TLE75602 for the rest of outputs), then it's definitely better to use more expensive TLE8110ED
  - input circuitry?
    - series resistor (8-channel arrays: CAY16-102J8LF)
      * it seems that MKE14F already has some input series resistance of 2-5kOm on all ADC pins, but we still need ours
      * 1k+1nF gives 160kHz bandwidth
    - TVS-diodes array (8-channel arrays: SP8008-08UTG, ESD7016MUTAG, 4-channel: DF5A6.8LJELM)
    - or EMI-filters with ESD-protection? (6-channel NUF6400MN etc.)
    - small filtering caps (4-channel arrays: CA064X103K1RACAUTO)
    - optional pullups/pulldowns (needed for some sensors)
  - voltage reference outputs for sensors
    - we need 2-3 configurable resistive voltage dividers (2.5v by default) with filter caps
    - used by VR and knock sensors in 'fake' bipolar mode (sensor "zero" is aligned with 2.5v reference voltage, and we get 0..5v swing for ADC input)
  - battery voltage divider & TVS-protecion (RBO40-40G?)
  - misc. passive circuity
    - 4 passive caps for Kinetis

	* The reason to use this module is poor on-board regulator:
		"The 3.3 Volt power is supplied by an RT9193 'DE=AD' voltage regulator. This regulator is underpowered to supply both the STM32 and the SD card, 
		 let alone external peripherals. If you use the SD card and require more power, you have to supply the board externally or replace the regulator."
	  RT9193 is in SOT-23-5 package, so we'd better use our external regulator board.
