Planned functionality:
- INPUTS
  - one VR trigger detection channel (adaptive threshold, noise pre-filtering)
	* wish: 2-3 channels
  - one knock detection channel
  	* wish: 2 channels
  - 4 ion sense detection channels
  - digital interrupt channels for Phase sensor & Vehicle speed densors
  	* with: 
  - ADC read:
    - Battery voltage
    - MAF or up to 4 MAP sensors
    - ...
- SPI output
- direct GPIO output of triggers

Wish-list:
- crankshaft acceleration measurement and missfire detection
