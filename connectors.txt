Main ECU connector.

The idea is to have 3 options:
1) Use one universal automotive-grade connector for custom-made harness
2) Solder wires directly to the pcb
3) Solder "car adapter" board with vendor-specific connector and pinout

In a nutshell, we have this as a default option for Deucalion board:
1) A popular chinese 81-pin connector has a compact footprint compatible with 121-pin connector and simple 2.54mm double-header connectors (for adapter boards)
2) It's rather cheap but it seems that not available in the USA/Europe?
3) Has a compatible sealed housing (available both new and salvageable from used ECUs)
4) Can be fully trace-routed even on 2-layer pcb
5) Female 81-pin harness connector is popular in many OEMs as a part of 121-pin connector

PCB board size estimate based on photo:
287.5 pixels = 18*2.54 mm = 45.72 mm
1 pixel = 45.72/287.5 = 0.159026 mm
We're taking the area with most hight:
628x448 = 100 x 71 mm

TE 1241434-1 (121 pin) "german" type
	* has 76 2.54mm-compatible pins (two double-row 19*2*2)
	* sealed
	* and all 76 pins can be routed out on 2-layber pcb, yay! :)
	* it seems it's the only high-pin-count sealed TE connector with 2.54mm pitch!
	* and we use only half of it...
	* and it's suitable for direct pcb-pcb soldering - boards will overlap less than 20mm
	* we need to put holes under plastic barbs of connector

Direct pcb-pcb soldering connection:
* two options here: (side view)
  a) using 2.54mm double pcb header connector in a standard way:
	----------|---
	        XX|XX
	       ---|---------------
	 In this case, one board is ~4mm upper than another (for 1.6mm thickness).
  b) putting pcbs tightly together, without any gaps:
	----------|---
	       ---|---------------
	        XX|XX
	 In this case, one board is only 1.6mm upper than another (for 1.6mm thickness).
	 This is a non-recommended way because traces on both pcbs are separated only by thin solder masks.

The main question is: do we need to follow some existing OEM pinout?..
